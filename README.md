Enter Healthy Jungle. Mandy can search specifically for recipes that avoid tree nuts.

Mickey always eats out instead cooking at home. However, the bills are racking up and so are the lbs. She now wants to save up and slim down. Mickey had brief success with a keto diet in the past and wants to try again. She needs a way to eat healthy on a keto diet without breaking the bank by eating out all the time. Healthy Jungle can provide Mickey with a wide array of keto-specific recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert!

Mordecai just moved from NY to a new city in the Midwest for work. Until his move, he lived at home and didn’t have to worry about cooking for himself. He isn’t yet familiar with what his new home has to offer in terms of food, but it doesn’t seem to be kosher-friendly, so eating out isn’t an option. With Healthy Jungle, he has access to kosher recipes like mom used to make and a few new ones too. He’s able to see what ingredients he needs.
